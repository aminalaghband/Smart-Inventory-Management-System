# Smart Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Smart Inventory Management System is a Python-based application designed to help small businesses manage their inventory efficiently. It uses machine learning to predict future inventory needs and optimize stock levels, reducing costs and improving efficiency.

## Features
- **Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of stock levels, sales, and purchases.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future inventory needs based on historical data.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Optimize stock levels and reorder points.
- **User Interface**: Simple web interface for users to interact with the system.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cryptoer-satoshi/Smart-Inventory-Management-System.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd smart_inventory
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Prepare your data in a CSV file with columns day and sales.
2. Load the data and create an instance of the SmartInventory class.
3. Train the model and make predictions:

```bash
from smart_inventory import SmartInventory

data = {
    'day': range(1, 31),
    'sales': [/* your sales data */]
}

inventory_system = SmartInventory(data)
inventory_system.train_model()
print("Predicted sales for the next 30 days:", inventory_system.predict_sales(range(31, 61)))
print("Optimal stock level:", inventory_system.optimize_inventory())
```
